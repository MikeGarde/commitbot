**Commitbot** analyzes your staged Git changes and helps you craft clear, consistent commit messages that describe *why* changes were made — not just *what* changed.

It can summarize diffs, ask you how each file relates to the purpose of the commit, and produce structured, readable messages your teammates (and future self) will thank you for.

---

## Features

- 🧩 **Interactive “ask” mode** – Classify each file as main, supporting, or consequential.
- ⚡ **Quick mode** – Instantly summarize staged diffs into a commit message.
- 🧠 **LLM-powered** – Uses OpenAI’s GPT models to generate concise and structured messages.
- 🔧 **Configurable** – Choose models, tweak behavior, and set defaults in a config file.
- 🧾 **Pull request summaries** – Generate clean, readable PR descriptions from your commit history.

---

## Installation

You’ll need an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Homebrew

```bash
brew tap mikegarde/tap
brew install commitbot
```

## Download a Prebuilt Binary

1. Visit the [latest release](https://github.com/MikeGarde/commitbot/releases/latest).
2. Download the binary for your platform.
3. Make it executable and move it into your PATH:

```bash
chmod +x commitbot
sudo mv commitbot /usr/local/bin/
commitbot --version
```
## Rust/Cargo
### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeGarde/commitbot.git
cd commitbot
cargo install --path . --force
```

### Install Directly from Git

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/MikeGarde/commitbot --force
```

---

## Usage

### Simple Mode

Analyze all staged changes and generate a commit message in one step:

```bash
commitbot
```

---

### Interactive Mode

Walk through each staged file and describe how it relates to the main purpose of the commit:

```bash
commitbot --ask
```

For each file, select:

```
1) Main purpose
2) Supporting change
3) Consequence / ripple
4) Ignore
```

After all files are classified, Commitbot summarizes and generates the full commit message.

---

### Pull Request Summaries

Generate high-level PR descriptions by summarizing commit messages instead of diffs:

```bash
commitbot pr develop
commitbot pr develop feat/ISSUE-201-registration
```

Commitbot will:

- Collect all commits between the base (`develop` or `main`) and the feature branch.
- Group commits referencing PR numbers (e.g. `#123`).
- Summarize them into a clear, cohesive description.

---

## Configuration

Commitbot looks for a configuration file at:

```bash
~/.config/commitbot/config.toml
```

Example:

```toml
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

You can override these settings with CLI flags or environment variables.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support for local/offline LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio).
- [ ] Model auto-detection and fallback.
- [ ] Configurable commit message templates.
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Actions or CI pipelines.

---

## ⚠️ Privacy Notice

> At this time, `commitbot` sends staged diffs to OpenAI’s API for analysis.
> 
> Future versions will support **self-hosted** and **local** model endpoints (e.g. Ollama, LM Studio, or API-compatible providers) so your code can stay fully private.
